# Bank Account Application Documentation

## Overview
This Bank Account Application allows users to manage their bank accounts through various functionalities such as viewing funds, depositing, transferring, withdrawing, and saving/loading user information to a JSON file.

## Functionalities

### Viewing Funds
Users can view the current balance of their bank account. This functionality provides a quick and easy way to check the available funds.

### Depositing Funds
Users can deposit money into their bank account. The deposited amount is added to the current balance, and the new balance is updated accordingly.

### Transferring Funds
Users can transfer money from their bank account to another account. 

### Withdrawing Funds
Users can withdraw money from their bank account. The withdrawn amount is subtracted from the current balance, and the new balance is updated accordingly.

### Saving User Information
User information, including account details and transaction history, can be saved to a JSON file. This allows users to persist their data and retrieve it later.

### Loading User Information
Users can load their information from a JSON file. This functionality allows users to restore their account details from a previously saved state.

# Original vs refactored

## The Original code had a few issues. Namely hwo it handled user input, but it was also long and winding.
This made troubleshooting it difficult do to the fact so much could go wrong and there was no funnel point for any of the
code functions to go to. However it contains every line of code in resonable enough segments so checking isn't as disastrous, it also includes some
accounts that are not needed

## The refactored version fixes pretty much al of that, and should be used at any given point in time if possible
